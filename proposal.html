        <h1>Problem Description</h1>
        <h3>Question of interest?</h3>
        <p>The area of interest I'm focusing on for this project is literature. I'm an avid reader and writer so this area seems like the perfect place for me to build a tool that I would like to use. The problem that I'm focusing on is addressing current issues with Goodreads' user interface and experience.</p>
        <h3>What is the information technology problem?</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">Goodreads</a> is the most well known service for cataloguing books for personal use. They allow users to sort books into bookshelves, explore books they might be interested in, and leave reviews. I want to address some well known UX issues that users have with the mobile application. I will be focusing specifically on the <em>shelving</em> concept, drawing inspiration from Spotify, Pinterest, etc.</p>
        <h3>What already exists?</h3>
        <p>Goodreads already exists on its own as an established application, however, I want to create a website that serves as a sort of proposal for how Goodreads could elevate a part of their user experience.</p>
    </section>

        <h1>Proposed Application</h1>
        <h3>Who are the users of this application?</h3>
        <p>This would be meant for current, new, or prespective Goodreads users who want a more modern experience for sorting books. I also want to make sure the books that are being reccommended are from all backgrounds so that people are able to get exposure to books written by BIPOC, female, LGBTQ+, and/or disabled authors, because the publishing world is not exempt from the systemic effects of racism, ableism, sexism, and intolerance of any kind.</p>
        <section>
            <h3>Interactive Features</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Allow users to <em>create a bookshelf</em> in which they can add books. There will be various customization options for each bookshelf.</li>
                <li>Users can sort and filter through existing books that will be accessed through datasets pulled from Goodreads.</li>
                <li>Log into an account so that they can save their bookselhves and access them whenever.</li>
                <li>Add reviews to any book that is only for their consumption (i.e they see it when they shelf a book, no other users will see).</li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <h3>Data Sources</h3>
        <p>I will primarily be using Kaggle Datasets here, such as this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks">dataset with Goodreads books</a> or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/goodreads-books">Goodreads dataset with links to the cover art</a>. It is an option to use the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/api">Goodreads API</a>, but I'm not completely confident that that is a good idea, since I will be working alone. I plan to discuss it further with my TA, though I can imagine I could achieve the goal of the website either using Kaggle scraped datasets or the Goodreads API. Also it is an option to use <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset">Amazon books data</a> for more diverse data.</p>
        <h3>How will this solve my original problem?</h3>
        <p>This application will allow me to use creativity and user research to address concerns with Goodreads' existing feature of book shelving. I can also work to find data on books written by or featuring POC so that the application works to address issues around low visibility for BIPOC authors and encourages diversity of reading for users.</p>
